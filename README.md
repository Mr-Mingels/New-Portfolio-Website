## **Project Introduction:**

Welcome to the repository of my new personal portfolio website. This site is designed to showcase my technical skills, professional projects, and provide insight into my background and experience in the field of software development

Built with the power of React, the website is organized as a Single Page Application (SPA) which provides a seamless browsing experience. From the landing page, users can smoothly navigate to any section of the website using the sidebar, with options including 'About Me', 'Projects', 'Skills', and 'Contact Me'.

Through its modern and responsive design, the website ensures an engaging user experience across all devices.
